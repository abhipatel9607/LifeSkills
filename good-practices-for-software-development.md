### Question 2
Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?<br>
**Answer**-<br>
I need to get better at writing down what happens each day and taking notes during discussions. It's important to use group chats more than private messages for communication. I should also turn on my video during meetings to build a better connection with my team. When I want to talk to my teammates, I need to check when they are available. Being on time for meetings is essential, so I should join 10 minutes early. To stay focused, I should block social media when I'm working and keep my phone on silent. Tracking my time and energy levels with an app can help me be more productive. Lastly, I need to manage my food and make sure I exercise to keep my energy up.
